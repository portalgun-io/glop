Glop (Game Library Of Power) is a fairly simple cross-platform game library.

- gin - Input manager, simple interface that supports buttons, mouse wheels and mouse axes, and a way of describing key-combos.
- gos - Os-specific code, every supported operating system must be made to conform to the system.System interface.
- system - Describes the interface that all supported operating systems must conform to.  This is seperated from gos so that it can be tested more easily.
- util - Some basic algorithms useful in a lot of places.
